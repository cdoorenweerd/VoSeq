It's a unique database that enables to\r\ndigitize biological data of museum specimens and molecular data such as\r\nDNA sequences, primers and genes.\r\n\r\nVoSeq has tools that facilitate the batch upload of lots of voucher data\r\nand DNA sequences with a few clicks. It also has\r\n[BLAST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST/) capabilities, meaning that\r\nyou can find out whether one particular DNA sequence is most similar to\r\nother sequence in [NCBI GenBank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).\r\nYou can also BLAST your sequence against all others in your VoSeq\r\ndatabase (see :ref:\\`blast-plugin\\` section for details).\r\n\r\nVoSeq is written mainly in [PHP](http://www.php.net/). It uses\r\n[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) as back-end and it is designed to run in a\r\nlocal server (for example by installing\r\n[Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) on your computer) or to run on any\r\ncommercial server service.\r\n\r\n![image](images/intro1.png)\r\n![image](images/create_taxonset2_small.png)\r\n![image](images/create_dataset_small.png)\r\n### How to cite VoSeq\r\n\r\nIf you think VoSeq is useful and you happen to use it during your work,\r\nit would be great if you cite us as a source:\r\n\r\n-   Peña, C. & Malm, T. **2012**.
