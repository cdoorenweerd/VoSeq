.. note:: Here we will describe new information regarding VoSeq, as well as list changes in new versions of the software.

As of version 1.5.0 we have implemented more information to be stored and used for genes/alignments!

    * For example introns (or other non-wanted regions), and genetic codes and reading frames for protein coding genes are now set for each gene.
    * Now can also gene tables be made with characteristics for each gene/alignment (for chosen taxonset) such as length, gene type, parsimony informative sites, nucleotide content etc.

We have tried out a perhaps easier way of installation for Apache, MySQL and PHP with the XAMPP package (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
See installation instructions for windows systems. Hope it makes things easier!
